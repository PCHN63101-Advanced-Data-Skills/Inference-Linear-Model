If we instead state that theory $T$ is *probably* true, then we have moved from pure reason into the world of probability. By saying that $T$ is *probably* true, we are accepting that it may be incorrect and thus the conclusion is not a certainty based on the premises."

    "## Statistical Inferences as Induction\n",
    "On the face of it, statistical inference is precisely an exercise in induction. As such, taking a hard-nosed perspective, statistical inference can *never* be logically justified. Fundamentally, statistical inference is based on assuming that predictions about the future will resemble the past and thus cannot be justified using pure logic. Although this may seem highly problematic, induction within statistics (as well as more broadly in science) can be coherently structured, pragmatically justified and rationally defensible, even if it cannot make peace with a pure framework of logic. In other words, statistical inference is *useful*, even if it is on shaky logical ground."
